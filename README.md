# Diffusers tutorials

Welcome to the Diffusers Tutorials repository by vroger11! This collection of tutorials is designed to help you explore and understand the [diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) by reproducing some exercises from the [deeplearning.ai course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/how-diffusion-models-work/) and beyond (coming soon).

## Installation

To get started, youâ€™ll need to install the necessary dependencies. We recommend using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the project environment:

1. Ensure you have Poetry installed. If not, you can follow the [installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx).
2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

    ```zsh
    poetry install
    ```

This will set up a virtual environment and install all the required packages specified in the pyproject.toml file.
Then, you can use vscode to use this environment and run the notebooks.

## Tutorials

All tutorials can be found in the `tutorials` folder. Each tutorial is paired with an in-depth blog post for further learning and context.

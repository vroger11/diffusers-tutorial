# Diffuser tutorials

This repository aims to be a simple tutorial for the [diffuser library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers). The aim is to reproduce exercises from the [deeplearning.ai course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/how-diffusion-models-work/) using as much of the diffuser library as possible.

## Installation

Use the conda/mamba environment (`environment.yaml` file).

```zsh
conda env create --file environment.yaml
conda activate diffuser-tutorial
```
